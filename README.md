# Hey there! Glad to see you here

<!-- ## 🧑‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a senior backend engineer with a passion for crafting systems that don’t crash when traffic spikes or when your boss suddenly wants “real-time everything.” I’ve been in the game for over six years, building rock-solid solutions for organizations like **One Acre Fund (OAF)**, **UNDP**, **Baobab Health Trust (BHT)**, and the **Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)**.

## ⚙️ What Do I Do?

I build backend systems that:

[x] Scale gracefully (no meltdowns allowed)
[x] Perform like Ferraris, not old tractors
[x] Stay secure even when hackers try to get cute
[x] Talk smoothly with other services, APIs, and databases
[x] Deliver insights without making you dig through 14 spreadsheets

I handle everything from architecture to deployment. If it lives on the backend, it’s my playground.

## 🛠️ Tech I Use (aka My Superpowers)

- **ASP.NET Core** – My go-to for blazing-fast, clean, and testable APIs
- **Microservices** – Because monoliths are so 2008
- **Docker & Kubernetes** – For deploying things in containers like a backend chef
- **Azure & AWS** – Cloud platforms? I speak both fluently
- **CI/CD & DevOps** – Code should ship faster than Amazon Prime
- **SQL & NoSQL** – I get data, whether it’s relational or doing its own thing

---

## ❤️ What I'm Passionate About

- Writing code that's clean, efficient, and borderline poetic
- Solving real-world problems with elegant solutions
- Helping teams move faster without breaking stuff
- Making technical things sound simple (even to your product manager)
- Building systems that *just work* — even when you're asleep

## 🤝 Let's Work Together

Whether you’re a startup, a large org, or just someone who knows they need a solid backend — I’m here to help.
